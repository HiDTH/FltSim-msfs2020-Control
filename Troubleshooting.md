Please check the known issues from file Changelog.md

If the buttons show long strings of text that shouldn't be there then the MSFS Plugin has not been properly installed or Touch Portal needs to be fully closed and restarted

Please report any other issues using the 'Issues' tab above


# Troubleshooting problems with the Touch Portal MSFS Plugin

Installation Issues:
Please follow the installation instructions in the file Changelog.md - remember to fully close and restart Touch Portal to enable the plugin
 
  
Plugin not working:   (MSFS Connection Button remains off even though Flight Simulator is running)
Check the plugin is enabled and started from Touch Portal > Settings > Plugins
Occasionally Touch Portal crashes leaving the Plugin open.  Windows 10 process 'MSFSTouchPortalPlugin.exe' needs to be killed from the Details tab of the Windows Task Manager - alternatively restarting Windows 10 will do the trick
