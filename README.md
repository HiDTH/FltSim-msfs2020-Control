I sometimes run the page on my Galaxy Tab in Portrait mode, and other times on my iPad in Landscape mode, so I have both versions installed.  
Firstly install the Portrait mode page into Touch Portal then delete all of the 'Global Objects - States' or custom states that start with 'fsc.', next install the Landscape version of the page before restarting Touch Portal as above

# Notes
Please also reference the notes in Changelog.md

Tested and working well on both my iPad (IOS) and Samsung Galaxy Tab A10 (Android) - other devices may need the font sizes tweaking

Assumes default keyboard configuration and key assignments in Microsoft Flight Simulator 2020

Tested using single engine aircraft although nearly all functions should also work with multiple engines.  Not all aircraft support all functions i.e. some smaller aircraft are not equipped with autopilot or retractable undercarriage
