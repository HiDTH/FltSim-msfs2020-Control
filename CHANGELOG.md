# Changelog Ver 1.2

More buttons now working through the plug-in rather than using keypresses

Panel for Cockpit Camera Controls added so that the view can easily be moved or switched in the cockpit

Checks to prevent inadvertantly switching off the battery, alternator or engine unless parking brake is set

Parking Brake cannot be inadvertantly put on whilst in the air

Confirmation checks for setting mixture to lean, dumping fuel, or shutting off the fuel selector or fuel valve

Coarse and Fine adjustments for Autopilot Altitude, Heading, Airspeed and Vertical Speed settings

ATC Panel Button opens ATC window in MSFS (assuming it starts closed) other panel buttons close it again

Tested primarily with Cessna 172 Skyhawk (G1000)
 
 

KNOWN ISSUES

Not all aircraft have autopilot (or all autopilot functions available)

Some aircraft show lights as switched on whether they are or not

Certain functions still use keypresses and have no way of checking whether the item is active or not in FS (i.e. Active Pause, Camera Functions, Torch, ATC Window)

Take care switching fuel tanks as some aircraft do not have the option for Fuel Selector to be set to 'Both' causing fuel to stop flowing and the engine to stop

Throttle, Mixture, Prop RPM and Engine RPM do not auto-update - pressing any of those buttons should refresh the displayed figures
